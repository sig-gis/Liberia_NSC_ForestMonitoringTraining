# Introduction to Machine Learning
Machine Learning (ML) is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that involves training algorithms on large datasets to identify patterns and relationships between input variables, which can then be used to make predictions or decisions, improving prediction accuracy over time.

**Random Forest** is a simple type of ML.

## The Random Forest Classifier

In machine learning, a classifier is an algorithm that automatically sorts data into categories or classes. The goal of a classifier is to learn from training data and make accurate predictions about new data.

A random forest classifier is an ML algorithm that uses multiple decision trees to classify data into different categories. It's a collection of decision trees that are built from random subsets of a training set. The algorithm then aggregates the votes from each tree to determine the final class of a test object. 

It performs well in predicting most classes, but may struggle with classes that have similar characteristics in their data.
