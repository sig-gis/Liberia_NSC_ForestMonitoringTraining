# Liberia Geospatial Capacity Building Workshops for Forest Monitoring
This workshop aim to build participants' capacity to use remote sensing technologies (Earth observation satellites and drones) and machine learning techniques for forest monitoring. For a detailed overview, you can read the workshop's [concept note and full agenda](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ed5aAAm7OfiYvlKrU0aBoUlyP_KOmo6Ta8P0z2d4Mms/edit?usp=sharing).

#### Instructors:
Crystal Wespestad (cwespestad@sig-gis.com) and Jarrett Barbuto (jbarbuto@sig-gis.com) from Spatial Informatics Group (SIG)

## Expected outcomes of the workshop

#### Skills: 
- Increased understanding of CEO, SEPAL, and GEE tools
- Working knowledge of sampling design, machine learning, and map accuracy assessment
- Basic knowledge of planning and implementing drone flights
- Basic knowledge of analyzing drone data

#### Products:
- Draft CEO projects to be used for forest / non-forest training data collection and map validation
- A 2014 forest extent map that can be further refined after the workshop
- An example of analysis using drone imagery 


The lesson content for each workshop can be found in the tabs on the lefthand side panel. Additionally, you can find supplementary learning material under the **Resources** tab and a link to share/view photos from the workshop under the **Photos** tab.

# Support

This workshop was created by Spatial Informatics Group, contracted by NovaSphere.

The **MRV for Climate Action** Programme supports partner countries’ national development priorities and capacities to plan, finance, and achieve GHG emission reductions and the implementation of low-carbon solutions to local development challenges.

Towards these goals, Liberia has prepared a "National Evergreen Roadmap” (EG Roadmap) that outlines approaches to accelerate climate actions; strengthen and enhance multi-level climate governance, develop a more effective and efficient MRV system, and mobilize climate finance and investment. The coordinating framework also identifies support for global south-south cooperation.

Under the leadership of the Environmental Protection Agency of Liberia (EPA)—the EG Roadmap is the result of inter-ministerial and non-state actors’ collaboration, and was subsequently validated and endorsed by the participants at the MRV for Climate Action
Farmington Roundtable held in Monrovia, Jan 18-20, 2023.

Under the leadership of the EPA, the EG Roadmap is now informing the creation and implementation of strategic Transformative Pilots by national key actors and stakeholders.
