For a detailed overview, you can read the workshop's <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ed5aAAm7OfiYvlKrU0aBoUlyP_KOmo6Ta8P0z2d4Mms/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">concept note and full agenda</a>.

#### Instructors:
Crystal Wespestad (cwespestad@sig-gis.com) and Jarrett Barbuto (jbarbuto@sig-gis.com) from Spatial Informatics Group (SIG)

# Support

This workshop was created by Spatial Informatics Group, contracted by NovaSphere.

The **MRV for Climate Action** Programme supports partner countries’ national development priorities and capacities to plan, finance, and achieve GHG emission reductions and the implementation of low-carbon solutions to local development challenges.

Towards these goals, Liberia has prepared a "National Evergreen Roadmap” (EG Roadmap) that outlines approaches to accelerate climate actions; strengthen and enhance multi-level climate governance, develop a more effective and efficient MRV system, and mobilize climate finance and investment. The coordinating framework also identifies support for global south-south cooperation.

Under the leadership of the Environmental Protection Agency of Liberia (EPA)—the EG Roadmap is the result of inter-ministerial and non-state actors’ collaboration, and was subsequently validated and endorsed by the participants at the MRV for Climate Action
Farmington Roundtable held in Monrovia, Jan 18-20, 2023.

Under the leadership of the EPA, the EG Roadmap is now informing the creation and implementation of strategic Transformative Pilots by national key actors and stakeholders.
