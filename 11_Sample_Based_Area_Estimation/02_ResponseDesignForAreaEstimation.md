# Response Design
Response design is the guidelines for collecting the reference data, which will be the data used for the final estimates of area. The refernce data is collected by human interpreters, so you need to ensure standard protocols are in place to ensure consistently high quality data, as it will determine the quality of your final estimates.

Generally the response design is made up of three parts:
1. the design of your data collection system (your CEO project)
2. the training and protocols for your interpreters (your interpretation key)
3. your QA/QC procress


Here are some specific things to consider as part of your sample design:
- Spatial assessment unit, sample frame
- Sources of data (high res imagery, Landsat time series, field data)
- Labeling protocol, schema
- Defining agreement, map unit key, QA/QC
- Reference classification uncertainty: geolocation and interpreter variability
