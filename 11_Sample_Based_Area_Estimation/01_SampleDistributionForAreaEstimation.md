# Using AREA2 for Sample Distribution
Refer to the full directions on AREA2 on the [3. Sampling Design / Sampling Design using AREA2 page](/03_Sampling_Design/02_AREA2_sampling_design.md).

## Further Resources
We reviewed how to use AREA2 in a follow-up workshop to the main workshop event. The recording of that walk-through is [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oIiLt1I1oAF8WQIHUtkbHYQQQyzYhKD-/view?usp=sharing). You can stop watching at 16:00, when the topic switches to uploading the samples to CEO. 

The Google Sheets template we used in the follow-up workshop to calculate the number of samples per strata (proportional with a minimum sample size) is [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1O2-5G-W4lZET1e8tv4uyK_-6D93FIprmj7ksD4J1WtA/edit?usp=sharing). You can make a copy of the template in order to make your own edits.

You will most likely be using Stratified Random Sampling (using a map to inform the design, a minimum number of observations randomly placed in each category), so that is assumed here. However, for the area estimation of land cover change **you will be using a different map asset than was used in the video.**

## Option 1: Making a Stratification Map

The plan discussed in the workshop event was to use the land cover maps created using Random Forest, comparing them to make **LC Change Maps** to be used as the stratification maps for sample distribution.
