We reviewed how to use AREA2 in a follow-up workshop to this event. The recording of that walk-through is [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oIiLt1I1oAF8WQIHUtkbHYQQQyzYhKD-/view?usp=sharing). You can stop watching at 16:00, when the topic switches to uploading the samples to CEO. The Google Sheets template we used in the follow-up workshop to calculate the number of samples per strata (proportional with a minimum sample size) is [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1O2-5G-W4lZET1e8tv4uyK_-6D93FIprmj7ksD4J1WtA/edit?usp=sharing). You can make a copy of the template in order to make your own edits.
