# Before Flying 

When flying to collect data to process through photogrammetry there are a few considerations for conditions to produce the best products.  These conditions will not prevent data collection but will make the photogrammetry process difficult and could cause holes in the final products.  

### Ideal Flying Conditions
* Diffused light (cloudy skies)
* High sun angle (midday)
* Low wind (stable flight)

### Imperfect Flying Conditions
* Rain
* Low sun angle (Early morning or Late afternoon - these conditions cause shadows)
* High winds (less stable flights, if drone gets pushed around GPS can struggle keeping the system on track)

### Before Flying
Before flying there are a few checks that should be completed prior to launch
* Weather conditions
* Airspace - not planning to fly in restricted airspace and no other aircraft in the airspace inspect sectional charts and any temporary flight restrictions
* Inspect Drone - make sure the drone is in working order and there is no damage to any of the components

##### Assign roles of personnel involved
* Pilot in Command
* Visual Observers (Spotters)
###### Ensure clear lines of communication between all involved
