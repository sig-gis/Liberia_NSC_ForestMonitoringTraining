# Types of UAS Platforms

In this section, we will go over the types of UAS and their advantages and limitations.

# Overview 

## Fixed Wing UAS
### Characteritics
* Rigid winds, fuselage and properllers
* Nadir (straight-down) data collection 
* Ability to glide 

### Advantages 
* Highly efficient
* Ability to cover a large area in a single flight

### Limitations
* Requires a large area for landing (similar landing pattern to manned aircraft).
* Struggles in high wind conditions - gusts can affect stability and data collection.
* Cannot hover, these types of platforms must remain in motion, holding in a circular flight pattern
