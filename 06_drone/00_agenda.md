# Drone Flight Planning and Image Processing

Welcome to Drone Flight and Image Processing! In this portion of the workshop, we will discuss the steps in the drone flight planning process and then plan our own drone flight in DJI Pilot 2.  We will also do a short drone flight as a demonstration.  Finally, we will use example drone images to conduct drone image processing in Pix4Dmapper, producing an orthomosaic, a digital surface model (DSM) and a digital terrain model (DTM) as well as discussing other ways to analyze and manipulate the data. 


## Pre-workshop Set-up

1. Make sure you have [Pix4Dmapper](https://www.pix4d.com/download/pix4dmapper/) installed on your computer.
2. Make sure you have made a Pix4D account and activated your [14-day free Pix4Dmapper trial](https://support.pix4d.com/hc/en-us/articles/202560729-How-to-get-a-trial-of-Pix4Dmapper).
3. Download all the files from [this Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1evFZg4gZ99b4NHabrhMnxwjFJszIUKcU?usp=sharing) onto your computer.
