# Introduction

Welcome to Drone Flight and Image Processing! In this portion of the workshop, we will discuss the steps in the drone flight planning process and then plan our own drone flight in DJI Pilot 2.  We will also do a short drone flight as a demonstration.  Finally, we will use example drone images to conduct drone image processing in Pix4Dmapper, producing an orthomosaic, a digital surface model (DSM) and a digital terrain model (DTM) as well as discussing other ways to analyze and manipulate the data. 


## Pre-workshop Set-up
