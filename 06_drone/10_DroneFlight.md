### Launching and Landing DJI Drones
#### Launching:
1. Push RC controls down and toward the center at a 45‚Å∞ angle
2. Throttle up drone after propellers start spinning for a few seconds

#### Landing: 
1. Throttle down drone to lower altitude 
2. Orient drone so that it is facing the same direction as you
3. Continue to lower drone down until you are above landing area
4. Once drone is in position, hold down on throttle to automatically land drone

#### Best practices
* Level surface
