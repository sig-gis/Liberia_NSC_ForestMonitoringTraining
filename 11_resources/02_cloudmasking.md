# Cloud Masking Example Scripts

In the [GEE repository](https://code.earthengine.google.com/?accept_repo=users/ee-scripts/Liberia_Forest_SIG_workshops) for this workshop, you will find a folder called `cloudMasking_examples` containing some scripts with example cloud masking scripts called `HLS_cloudMasking`, `Planet_cloudMasking`, and `Sentinel_Landsat_cloudMasking`. You can use these scripts to compare various cloud masking techniques with the available optical imagery.
