# Classification with SEPAL

SEPAL (System for Earth Observation Data Access, Processing & Analysis for Land Monitoring) is a cloud-based platform designed to facilitate the processing and analysis of large-scale satellite imagery. It provides users with powerful tools to generate **analysis-ready data (ARD)**, perform **land cover classification**, and conduct **geospatial analysis** efficiently.

With SEPAL, users can:
- Access and process large remote sensing datasets without requiring high-end local computing resources.
- Generate **radar mosaics** and **optical composites** for further analysis.
- Apply advanced machine learning techniques for **land cover classification**.


## Objectives

1. Preprocess high-quality satellite imagery for further classification.
2. Develop robust classification models for monitoring and assessing land cover and changes.
