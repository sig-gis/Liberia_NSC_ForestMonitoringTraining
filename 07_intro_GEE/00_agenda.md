# Introduction to GEE

Here we will provide an overview of the Google Earth Engine cloud-based geospatial platform, its benefits over desktop geospatial software, access to a large catalog of remote sensing datasets, applications in GEE, the basics of programming language and main concepts. Much of the content is based on the [EEFA](https://eefabook.org) book.

## Pre-configuration

As mentioned in the pre-workshop set up page, joining the workshop Google Group will give you access to the **pc556-ncs-liberia-forest-mang** GEE Cloud Project, but you may also choose to make a noncommercial *Trainer & Trainees type* GEE Cloud Project of your own
