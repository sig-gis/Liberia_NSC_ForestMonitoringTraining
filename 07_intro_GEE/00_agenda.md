# Introduction to GEE

Here we will provide an overview of the Google Earth Engine cloud-based geospatial platform, its benefits over desktop geospatial software, access to a large catalog of remote sensing datasets, applications in GEE, the basics of programming language and main concepts. Much of the content is based on the <a href="https://eefabook.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">EEFA</a> book.

## Pre-configuration

As mentioned in the pre-workshop set up page, joining the workshop Google Group will give you access to the **pc556-ncs-liberia-forest-mang** GEE Cloud Project, but you may also choose to make a noncommercial *Trainer & Trainees* type GEE Cloud Project of your own. 


Create a <a href="https://code.earthengine.google.com/register" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Earth Engine account</a>. 

You will need a <a href="https://accounts.google.com/signup" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google account</a>. 

Create a GEE account for non-commercial purposes.

Follow the steps below if you want to register your own GEE cloud project:
