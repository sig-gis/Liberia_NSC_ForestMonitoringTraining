# Ways to Improve Accuracy...

### 1. Preprocessing
* increase the number of training and testing points
* change or combine cloud masking strategies
* composite imagery for more than 1 year
* merge or separate classes of interest (e.g. one combined forest class instead of separated forest classes, separate wetlands class)

### 2. Model Development
* add and remove predictor variables based on variable importance and accuracy (e.g. different combinations of imagery sources or indices)
* increase the number of trees in the random forest model

### 3. Postprocessing
* change smoothing functions
* overlay with hand-digitized data

# Challenges
