# Introduction

Welcome to Mangrove Mapping Using Multiple Sensors! This workshop will demonstrate a Random Forest classification mapping workflow using Landsat data. We will cover Image Collection filtering, merging, pre-processing, and finally, Random Forest model training, classification and accuracy assessment.

## Pre-workshop Set-up

### **[Detailed instructions on pre-workshop setup](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16N5wXbWi767AG4k-BPusu9Gc0HXKrY9qACFN9JZkiAA/edit?usp=sharing)**      

1. Ensure you are logged into your Google Earth Engine account.
2. Click this link to accept the Guyana GEE script repository - [https://code.earthengine.google.com/?accept_repo=users/ebihari/GuyanaWS](https://code.earthengine.google.com/?accept_repo=users/ebihari/GuyanaWS)
3. Create a new script file in your own script repository - name it 'Mangroves Classification - Landsat'. Keep in mind a master copy is available in the above script repository.
4. Check the full script - [https://code.earthengine.google.com/537c5ab42bbc2088b72de222fb961bb6](https://code.earthengine.google.com/537c5ab42bbc2088b72de222fb961bb6)

## Objectives
1. Understand the general process for training and applying a model in Google Earth Engine on satellite data
2. Adapt the provided workflow for a different area of interest and time period
3. Experiment with different ways to improve accuracy of your classification
