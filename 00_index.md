# Liberia Geospatial Capacity Building Workshops for Forest Monitoring
This workshop aim to build participants' capacity to use remote sensing technologies (Earth observation satellites and drones) and machine learning techniques for forest monitoring. For a detailed overview, you can read the workshop's [concept note](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ed5aAAm7OfiYvlKrU0aBoUlyP_KOmo6Ta8P0z2d4Mms/edit?usp=sharing).

## Expected outcomes of the workshop

#### Skills: 
- Increased understanding of CEO, SEPAL, and GEE tools
- Working knowledge of sampling design, machine learning, and map accuracy assessment
- Basic knowledge of planning and implementing drone flights
- Basic knowledge of analyzing drone data

#### Products:
- Draft CEO projects to be used for forest / non-forest training data collection and map validation
- A 2014 forest extent map that can be further refined after the workshop
- An example of analysis using drone imagery 


The lesson content for each workshop can be found in the tabs on the lefthand side panel. Additionally, you can find supplementary learning material under the **Resources** tab and a link to share/view photos from the workshop under the **Photos** tab.
